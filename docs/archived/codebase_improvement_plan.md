# Codebase Improvement Recommendations for OllamaRepl

After analyzing the codebase, I've identified several opportunities for improving the organization, maintainability, and extensibility of the OllamaRepl project.

## Current Architecture Overview

The codebase follows a modular approach with several key components:
- **Repl**: Main application logic and REPL loop
- **Client**: Handles API communication with Ollama
- **CommandHandler**: Processes slash commands (recently extracted)
- **ContextManager**: Manages conversation history (recently extracted)
- **Config**: Handles environment variable configuration

The recent refactoring to extract CommandHandler and ContextManager from the Repl class was a good step toward better separation of concerns.

## Key Improvement Opportunities

### 1. Further Modularize the Repl Class

The `Repl` class still handles multiple responsibilities:
- REPL loop management
- Mode switching logic
- Input processing
- Ruby code execution
- Shell command execution
- LLM interaction

**Recommendation**: Extract these concerns into dedicated classes:
- Create a `ModeManager` class to handle mode switching and management
- Extract execution logic into an `ExecutionEnvironment` hierarchy
- Move input processing to a dedicated class

### 2. Implement a Strategy Pattern for Modes

Currently, mode-specific behavior is managed through case statements, making it difficult to add new modes.

**Recommendation**: Implement a Strategy pattern with a `Mode` interface and concrete implementations for LLM, Ruby, and Shell modes. This would make adding new modes like Python or JavaScript much easier.

```ruby
# Example implementation
module OllamaRepl
  class Mode
    def handle_input(input, context_manager)
      raise NotImplementedError, "Subclasses must implement handle_input"
    end
    
    def prompt
      raise NotImplementedError, "Subclasses must implement prompt"
    end
  end
  
  class LlmMode < Mode
    def initialize(client)
      @client = client
    end
    
    def handle_input(input, context_manager)
      # LLM-specific input handling
    end
    
    def prompt
      "🤖 ❯ "
    end
  end
  
  # Similar implementations for RubyMode and ShellMode
end
```

### 3. Create an Execution Environment Abstraction

The `handle_ruby_input` and `handle_shell_input` methods contain similar patterns that could be abstracted.

**Recommendation**: Create an `ExecutionEnvironment` class hierarchy to encapsulate the execution logic:

```ruby
module OllamaRepl
  class ExecutionEnvironment
    def execute(code, context_manager)
      raise NotImplementedError
    end
    
    def capture_output
      raise NotImplementedError
    end
  end
  
  class RubyExecutionEnvironment < ExecutionEnvironment
    def execute(code, context_manager)
      # Ruby execution logic
    end
    
    def capture_output(code)
      # Output capture logic for Ruby
    end
  end
  
  class ShellExecutionEnvironment < ExecutionEnvironment
    # Shell-specific implementation
  end
end
```

### 4. Enhance Error Handling

Error handling is inconsistent across the codebase.

**Recommendation**:
- Create a hierarchy of custom exception classes
- Implement centralized error handling in the main REPL loop
- Add more detailed logging for debugging

### 5. Improve Configuration System

The current configuration is limited to just host and model.

**Recommendation**:
- Expand configuration options (history file, prompt customization)
- Support yaml or json configuration files
- Add validation for all configuration options

### 6. Add Testing Infrastructure

There appears to be no visible testing framework.

**Recommendation**:
- Add RSpec or Minitest for unit testing
- Create mocks for the Ollama API
- Implement integration tests for the REPL functionality

### 7. Client Optimizations

The Client class could be enhanced:

**Recommendation**:
- Add connection pooling or retry logic
- Improve the caching mechanism for model lists
- Add better streaming optimization and error recovery

## Implementation Plan

A phased approach would work best:

1. **Phase 1**: Implement the Mode Strategy pattern
2. **Phase 2**: Extract the Execution Environment classes
3. **Phase 3**: Enhance error handling and logging
4. **Phase 4**: Improve the configuration system
5. **Phase 5**: Add testing infrastructure

This approach would incrementally improve the codebase while maintaining functionality at each step.
